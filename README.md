# Javascript CRUD with SampleTasks

A React application to demonstrate the comprehensive CRUD app built using ReactJS and Firebase. It demonstrates how to implement user authentication with both Google Sign-In and username/password login methods, along with other key features such as API handling, local storage CRUD operations, and managing application state using Redux. The app also leverages modern React hooks, lifecycle methods, and routing for smooth navigation between pages.

## Features
- **User authentication with Google Sign-In**: Users can sign in using their Google accounts using Firebase for secure authentication.
- **Username/Password Authentication**: Custom username and password login using Firebse for added flexibility.
- **CRUD Operations**: Ability to perform create, read, update, and delete operations with data stored in local storage.
- **API Handling with Axios**: Handled API requests using Axios for fetching data from remote servers.
- **Data Management with Redux**: Efficiently manage app state using Redux store to handle data across components.
- **React Hooks and Lifecycle Methods**: Utilization of React hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef and lifecycle methods for optimal component behavior.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented navigation between pages with React Router for a dynamic user experience.
- **Loader Implementation**: Display a loader during asynchronous operations to improve user experience.
- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive UI with styling using CSS and modern design principles.
- **Header and Footer**: The header includes navigation tabs, and the footer provides links to "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages.
